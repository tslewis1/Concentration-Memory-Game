## Description

A memory game like Concentration where the user matches sets of cards.

## Instructions

Click on two cards to see if they match. If they do, that's great! If not, the cards will flip back over and it's time to try again. Try and remember where the card pairs are. 

There is a timer that runs as well as a move counter to challenge you. You are also being rated on the efficency of your game play, so the more moves used lowers the rating. 

The game is over when you have successfully matched all 16 cards.
